java8 features and examples


Lambdas
1) Enables to write Functional Programming.
2) write better api's and libraries.
3) Enables Parallel Processing.


Why Lambdas
Is Functional Programming really needed?
1) write more readable code.
2) more cleaner code.
3) it is used for some set of problems.

Probems with Code in OOP
1) Everything is an object
2) All code blocks are "associated" with classes and objects.

We cannot put code as an action.
it should be associated with classes.(nouns)

In OOP, we cannot pass behaviour. 
We have to pass a thing that has a behaviour. (like a class or interface instead of method)


But using lambdas,
create functions which are called lambda expressions.
they are just functions in isolations. they are not associated with any classes.

and these functions can be used as values.
it implies, 

similar to String name="123"
can  we assign block of code to a variable.
it's nothing but assigning method to a variable.
and pass the variable(implies piece of code).
call that function using the variable it is assigned to.


Functional Interface
1) Interface which contains only one abstract method.


java.util.Functions
1) This package contains all types of functional interfaces.
2) all possible patterns are created. so these can be reused for lambda expressions instead of writing new interfaces.
